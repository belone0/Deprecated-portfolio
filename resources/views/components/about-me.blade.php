        Hi! I'm Jo√£o. Ever since I was a child, I always liked technology, playing video games and fiddling
        with the terminals, which made
        me
        gravitate towards coding. Today, I am currently studying Computer Science and working as a
        Fullstack Web Developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've had the privilege of building web and mobile solutions for a platform that has more than 100
        thousand users,
        working as a team
        to deliver the best, as fast as possible. I've also participated in several hackathons, coding,
        building and presenting projects against the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not working or studying, I'm playing guitar, working out, reading some book or playing
        video games.
